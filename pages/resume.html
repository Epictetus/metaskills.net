<h2>Influences &amp; Values</h2>

<ul>
  <li>A hardcore aversion to complexity.</li>
  <li>Often solve low level problems in isolation to keep focus on high level needs.</li>
  <li>Will not use libraries that are untested.</li>
  <li>Reading code. The docs are in there too. Bundle open is your friend.</li>
  <li>Teaching is the best way avenue to learning. Perform occupational maintenance.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
  Software developer that loves problem solving using Ruby, JavaScript (CoffeeScript) or Objective-C. Previous careers in ops, marketing and <a href="/2011/09/11/revisiting-my-design-past/">design</a> combine to add value at all levels. I take ownership of my tasks, have a strong work ethic, and require no hand holding. So whether it is a low level database stack or a high level user interface design, I am right at home.
</p>

<h2>Highlights of Qualifications</h2>

<p>
  <strong>PROGRAMMING SKILLS:</strong> Authored and collaborated on numerous open source projects in all these languages. To date, I have been programming web applications using Ruby and JavaScript for {{ site.time | date: "%Y" | minus:2005 }} years. My HTML/CSS skills far exceed most programmers since I have been developing web sites for {{ site.time | date: "%Y" | minus:1996 }} years and have been doing semantic and unobtrusive presentation layer CSS for {{ site.time | date: "%Y" | minus:2004 }} years.
</p>

<!-- <p>
  <strong>WEB APPLICATION EXPERIENCE:</strong> Ruby and especially the Rails framework is my love and focus. I have been working in Rails since before its version was 1.0 and migrations were even in the framework. Unlike a lot of other programmers, I know the Rails framework inside and out and I specialize in ActiveRecord gems. My code is highly organized and I pride myself in working smarter by keeping up to date in the changing landscape of both Ruby and Rails as the technologies move forward. My second love is the Prototype JavaScript framework and programming interactive glue in a fully object oriented way.
</p> -->

<!-- <p>
  <strong>INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SKILLS:</strong> Administrating UNIX operating systems in small to mid-size networks, with an emphasis on OSX client/server. Experience in managing Rails applications in production environments utilizing Apache/Mongrel/Capistrano. System Administration skills includes managing postfix/cyrus mail, open directory, split horizon DNS, MySQL, firewalls, and virtual private networks. I am also familiar with configuring Cisco and Extreme Networks routers/switches.
</p> -->

<p>
  <strong>TOOLS OF THE TRADE:</strong> UNIX is my integrated development environment, specifically a Mac using ZSH shell with Sublime Text 2. I currently use rbenv and pow for my local development stack with a back-end of MacPorts for anything else. Yes, MacPorts! I happen to like the /opt sandbox concept which keeps Apple's OS upgrades from hosing my dynamically linked dependencies. Git is the only SCM I like, but I have experience in many others.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>PEOPLE SKILLS:</strong> I love to work with talented people! Even more so, I like to teach and help others learn about the things I myself love to do. I am currently the organizer for the <a href="http://ruby.meetup.com/130/">Hampton Roads Ruby User's Group (757.rb)</a> where I give talks each and every month. Teaching others and writing articles is not only enjoyable, but helps me stay current with my craft.

    Senior developer on a very large multi-tenant Rails application for the heavy duty (class 7 and 8) truck industry. Experience maintaining and upgrading Rails from version 1.0 to current 3.2 version. Maintained the entire SQL Server stack for both Ruby and Rails. Sole author of the existing ActiveRecord adapter as well as the TDS protocol layer, a Ruby C extension which communicates to the database. This was done to ensure modern standards for web application encoding and platform longevity. More can be found on guest blog posts of mine titled <a href="http://bit.ly/h3cuON">Modern SQL Server &amp; Rails</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/m3eOxl">SQL Server 10x Faster with Rails 3.1</a> on the Engine Yard blog.

  <!-- <p>
      Engineered solutions for a custom testing foundation that legacy databases posed to the normal Rails development cycle. This included writing low level rake tasks that piped Windows commands to database boxes over SSH for cloning the entire schema and stored procedures all from a UNIX process. Maintained a simple testing stack based on MiniTest::Spec using Factories while still under a database transaction. Allowing years of TDD code to still run quickly.
    </p> -->

    <a href="http://homemarks.com/">HomeMarks</a> is a AJAX start page geared towards todo or project-based bookmarking. The idea is a throwback to the HTML start pages we developers made for ourselves going back to 1996. I use HomeMarks as a way of staying on top of Rails best practices by rewriting much of it every few years. About {{ site.time | date: "%Y" | minus:2008 }} years ago I wrote v2.0 by building my own <a href="http://bit.ly/w0ljee">MVC JavaScript framework</a> and moving the Rails application to follow a <a href="http://bit.ly/hJYfNA">service oriented design</a>. This put me years ahead of frameworks such as Backbone.js or SproutCore. Shortly afterward, I build my first <a href="http://itunes.com/apps/homemarks">iPhone application</a> using HomeMarks new service layer and I have subsequently given talks to local and distant groups on how to integrate RESTful Rails applications with iOS' Core Data framework. I am currently writing v3.0 with an emphasis on Spine.JS and CoffeeScript on top of an HTML5/CSS3 web layer that utilizes Sass &amp; Compass CSS framework and my own hand coded CSS animations and transitions.

    As the sole developer created a multi-tenant Rails eCommerce application tailored for the coupon industry. Due to the unique nature of the digital goods, virtual inventorying and security, the entire application included strict business rules on the monthly inventory per retailer campaign that had timeout hooks in the front end shopping cart. Digital goods were compiled and delivered via a custom Java application per transaction that created serialized coupons with barcodes for that specific transaction by the central Rails application. Made extensive use of ImageMagick and the GNU Barcode Ruby wrappers. Developed payment processing utilizing both the direct and express checkout methods of PayPal's NVP API. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Built a community marketing site for the company's upcoming trading card game (TCG) called FightKlub. The majority of my involvement for this application involved developing customizations to Mephisto/Beast and deploying them into production. These sites can be currently found at <a href="http://www.decipher.com/">decipher.com</a> and include Prototype animations, custom liquid templates, and core extensions to Beast to register new founding mentors.

    Joined the Executive Committee to help provide steerage for the company's new business unit that focused entirely on eCommerce sales of closeout <a href="http://www.planetcdrom.com/" title="Arcamax, Inc. - Planet CD-ROM">CD-ROM Software</a> and <a href="http://www.planetdvdnow.com/" title="Arcamax, Inc. - Planet DVD Now">DVD Movie</a> titles. It was my responsibility to maintain the profitability of the company, which relied heavily upon my previous Online Marketing experience and my technical prowess to leverage their existing IT infrastructure and Internet Publishing assets.
  </p>

  <p>
    I successfully integrated all revenue and marketing channels into a trackable system that utilized a combination of their proprietary systems, 3rd party conversion tools, new custom code that captured and reported on aggregate data. A summary of these channels include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Retention Marketing System</li>
    <li>Search Marketing (Organic &amp; PPC)</li>
    <li>Affiliate Program &amp; Comparison Shopping Portals</li>
    <li>Online &amp; Offline Media Placement</li>
    <li>Virtual Drop Shippers</li>
    <li>Incentivised Loyalty Program</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- 
  <p>
    Completely overhauled the entire pay-per-click search engine (PPCSE) and affiliate marketing systems into a successful prospecting engine within 8 weeks time. Built and integrated conversion tracking code that identified campaign success to the keyword level and post-conversion metrics into the retention marketing system for up to one year past the initial conversion. Benefits of the new systems also reported on:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Product Category Performance</li>
    <li>Ad Copy Response</li>
    <li>Cart Bailout Metrics</li>
    <li>Click Fraud Sources</li>
    <li>Negative Keyword Terms</li>
    <li>Continuous Data Through the PayPal IPN</li>
    <li>Relevant Online Partnerships via AdSense &amp; Publisher Referrals</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Continually maximized PPCSE marketing from an average of 300 terms to over 30,000 terms and phrases with a 275% increase in buyers and overall campaign profitability. Added conceptually driven keyword campaigns and matching ad copy that captured nearly every tangible search a consumer would find offers and products. This was achieved using a combination of creative thinking at the consumer level and mining corporate date into datafeed campaigns that were dynamically driven by SKU metadata. Deployed keyword buys over the following 1st and 2nd tier PPCSEs, note that 3rd tier PPCSEs are rampant with click fraud and are not included Google, Overture (now YSMS!), MSN, Kanoodle, and the Kaboose Kids Search
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Revamped the affiliate marketing program from a passive ad-hoc system that was frequently abused by self-referrals to a managed, proactive, lead generation engine for online partnerships. Established myself as a visible program manager that affiliates could interact with. Encouraged growth by usage of good communications and publishing writing bi-monthly newsletters that contained informative articles on how to maximize and use the more advanced technical aspects of the program. Acquired power affiliates and relevant online partnerships that increased the programs direct sales up 500% with value added buyers into the retention marketing system.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Developed a 2-year business strategy that primarily focused on utilizing the company's previously untapped core strengths within their EC system for Internet Publishing and secondarily on the actionable data acquired over the previous 3 months. Plan called for a company-wide documentation process on key roles within Product Acquisition, Inventory Management, Web Development, Customer Service, Sales, and Support. The result was a shared knowledgebase <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki" title="What is a Wiki?">Wiki</a> that allowed me to appropriately adjust our internal processes to meet future sales goals. To compliment this and expand capacity, I organized an internship program with <a href="http://www.ecpi.edu/campus/new/" title="ECPI's Newport News Campus Homepage">ECPI's  Newport News</a> campus, to train upcoming graduates in the fields of Website Design, Development, and eCommerce.
